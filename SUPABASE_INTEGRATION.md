## Database Schema

All tables include:
- UUID primary keys (except newsletter_subscriptions which uses email as PK)
- `created_at` timestamp with timezone
- Row Level Security (RLS) enabled
- Public insert policies for form submissions
- Authenticated read policies for admin access

## Security Implementation

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- All tables have RLS enabled
- Public users can INSERT (submit forms)
- Only authenticated users can SELECT (view submissions)
- No UPDATE or DELETE permissions for public users

### Data Validation
- Client-side validation using Zod schemas
- Server-side validation through Supabase
- Email format validation
- Phone number format validation
- Required field validation

## Environment Variables Required

Create a `.env` file in the client directory:
```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

## Authentication Context

The `AuthProvider` component provides:
- User authentication state management
- Sign in/up/out functionality
- Session persistence
- Auth state change listeners

## Error Handling

Each form implements:
- Try-catch blocks for async operations
- User-friendly error messages
- Loading states during submission
- Form validation error display
- Network error handling
